### Error messages for future reference  
✖ Error: Invalid Character (typing ng --version in the terminal)   
Solution: Use bash (workaround)   
✖ Error: Property 'name' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.      
Solution: Add ```"strictPropertyInitialization": false``` in the compiler options of the tsconfig.json or a default value to the property.    
✖ Error: Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a known property of 'input'.      
Solution: Add FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule to the imports array in app.module.ts.    
✖ Error: Can't bind to 'ngForOf' since it isn't a known property of 'tr'.      
Solution: Add BrowserModule to app.module.ts or check for typos, ex: *ngfor, instead of *ngFor.
